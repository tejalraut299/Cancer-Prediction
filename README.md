Dataset Information:

Target Variable (y):
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten features (X) are computed for each cell nucleus:
1.radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2.texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3.perimeter
4.area
5.smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6.compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7.concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8.concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9.symmetry
10.fractal dimension (coastline approximation - 1)

For each characteristic three measures are given:
a. Mean
b. Standard error
c. Largest/ Worst
